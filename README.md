# Rubick2x2-auto-solve-system

***Description:*** The project focuses on building a system that can figure out how many moves needed to solve a mixed 2x2Rubick, or shortest way to solve a mixed rubick. The project used [breadth first search](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/graphs/breadth-first-search/tutorial/) algorithm to solve the problem. The project is for my learning purpose of more understanding in algorithm and complexity

## Installation guide:
